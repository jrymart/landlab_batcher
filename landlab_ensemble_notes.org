Landlab Ensemble Notes
This is a framework?  for running large sets of models over parameter space.  The goal is to
* make it easy to define many model runs simultaneously
* make it easy to run models across many processors/threads
** [[https://dask.org][dask]]?
** plain old python multiprocessing
* make it easy to save the output of model runs
this is the big question i think - how do we save this
** a bunch of seperate files (ascii/tiffs/whatever)
** a big netcdf file?
* make it easy to record model run parameters and metadata, summarized results
** sqlite
** a table for run parameters
*** do we want to add runs after they run 
*** or as they are initialized with a flag on iff they've run
I think this, so we can also keep track of if a run has failed
** a table for run metadata
** a table for results
* This means we need some sort of key identifying the model run
* We should use Greg's LandLabModel class?
